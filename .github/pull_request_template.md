## About your solution

I used a pandas to read de json file, the `function` must operate over this dataframe and then convert it to a cvs file.

## Your findings
It is a easy problem to solve using some tools.

## How to run your code?

All code is in `main.py` file and require 2 arguments: first a path to json file and a path to a csv file. The proposed solution accepts arguments via command line as follows:

`python3.10 data-engineer-1/main.py <path-to-json-file> <path-to-csv-file>`

The arguments can also be manually changed in the main() function inside `main.py` file.


Make sure the following packages are avaliable in your testing environment:
- pandas 1.4.4
